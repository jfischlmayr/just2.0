<h1>Get Started</h1>
<h1>Add Project</h1>
To get started you first need to create a new project <a href="/AddProject">here</a>.
Now you can move on to the next step.

<h1>Add Task</h1>
In the previous step you created a new project. To assign a task to this project, you have to go to the <a href="/Projects">project page</a>.
Now press the + icon at the project card, to which you want to add the task. This will redirect you to a new page,
where you can fill out the required fields and create a new task.

If you want, you can repeat this step, until you have all tasks created, which you wanted.

<h1>Display the Gantt-Diagram</h1>
The final step is to display the Gantt-Diagram for a specific project.
To do so, you can navigate to the <a href="/Gantt">gantt page</a>.
On this page you can select the project, you want to create the gantt-diagram for.
